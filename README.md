# 🐄 Smart Cow Tracker

**Smart Cow Tracker** is a precision livestock monitoring system designed to record, analyze, and visualize cattle weight data in real time. It connects to a **Tru-Test Bluetooth weighing scale**, automatically logs data into structured CSV files, and generates performance insights to support smarter farm management decisions.

## 🚀 Overview

The system was developed to modernize small and medium-scale cattle farms through data-driven monitoring. It enables the identification of growth patterns, weight trends, and anomalies that may indicate health or feeding issues — all without manual data entry.

## ⚙️ Core Features
- **Bluetooth Integration:** Connects directly to Tru-Test devices for seamless weight capture  
- **Automated Logging:** Stores data in organized CSV files for analysis  
- **Cow Identification:** Manual or automated ID input to link data with specific animals  
- **Data Analytics:** Trend detection, average weight tracking, and growth visualization  
- **Offline Compatibility:** Operates in rural environments without continuous internet access  

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, PyBluez (Bluetooth API)  
- **Data Format:** CSV (structured for long-term herd tracking)  
- **Environment:** Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## 📊 Example Workflow
1. Pair Tru-Test scale via Bluetooth  
2. Input cow ID or scan tag  
3. Automatically record and save weight data  
4. Generate analytics and visual plots for performance over time  

## 🌱 Impact
By automating livestock monitoring, Smart Cow Tracker enhances **efficiency**, **accuracy**, and **sustainability** in animal management. It represents a step toward **precision agriculture**, integrating affordable technology with real-world farming challenges.
